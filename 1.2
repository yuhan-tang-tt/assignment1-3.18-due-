1.2 Write a function named triangle_area_kahan that calculates the area of a triangle using the Kahan summation algorithm.

    import numpy as np

    def triangle_area_kahan(a, b, c):


        # Sort sides in decreasing order
        sides = np.sort([a, b, c])[::-1]
        a, b, c = sides[0], sides[1], sides[2]
    
        area = (1/4) * np.sqrt((a + (b + c)) * 
                              (c - (a - b)) * 
                              (a + (b - c)) * 
                              (a + (c - b)))
        return area
